**Aug 11, 2025: This project is semi-depricated, and is unmaintained except for being kept operational with new versions of PettingZoo until the relevant functionality can be merged into pettingzoo.wrappers.**

SuperSuit introduces a collection of small functions which can wrap reinforcement learning environments to do preprocessing ('microwrappers').
We support Gymnasium for single agent environments and PettingZoo for multi-agent environments (both AECEnv and ParallelEnv environments).


Using it with Gymnasium to convert space invaders to have a grey scale observation space and stack the last 4 frames looks like:

```
import gymnasium
from supersuit import color_reduction_v0, frame_stack_v1

env = gymnasium.make('SpaceInvaders-v0')

env = frame_stack_v1(color_reduction_v0(env, 'full'), 4)
```

Similarly, using SuperSuit with PettingZoo environments looks like

```
from pettingzoo.butterfly import pistonball_v0
env = pistonball_v0.env()

env = frame_stack_v1(color_reduction_v0(env, 'full'), 4)
```


**Please note**: Once the planned wrapper rewrite of Gymnasium is complete and the vector API is stabilized, this project will be deprecated and rewritten as part of a new wrappers package in PettingZoo and the vectorized API will be redone, taking inspiration from the functionality currently in Gymnasium.

## Installing SuperSuit
To install SuperSuit from pypi:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install supersuit
```

Alternatively, to install SuperSuit from source, clone this repo, `cd` to it, and then:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```
